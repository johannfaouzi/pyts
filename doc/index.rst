**pyts** is a Python package dedicated to time series classification.
It aims to make time series classification easily accessible by providing
preprocessing and utility tools, and implementations of several time series
classification algorithms.
The package comes up with many unit tests and continuous integration ensures
new code integration and backward compatibility.
The package is distributed under the 3-clause BSD license.


Minimal example
---------------

The following code snippet illustrates the basic usage of pyts:

    >>> from pyts.classification import BOSSVS
    >>> from pyts.datasets import load_gunpoint
    >>> X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = load_gunpoint(return_X_y=True)
    >>> clf = BOSSVS(window_size=28)
    >>> clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    BOSSVS(...)
    >>> clf.score(X_test, y_test)
    0.98

1. First we import:

  - a class defining a classifier (``BOSSVS``),
  - a function that loads the *GunPoint* dataset (``load_gunpoint``).

2. Then we load the training and test sets by calling the ``load_gunpoint`` function.

3. Next we define a classifier by creating an instance of the class.

4. Finally we fit the classifier on the training set and evaluate its
   performance by computing the accuracy on the test set.

People familiar with scikit-learn API should feel comfortable with pyts as
its API is heavily inspired from it, and pyts estimators are compatible
with scikit-learn tools like model selection and pipelines. For more
information, please refer to the
`Scikit-learn compatibility <scikit_learn_compatibility.html>`_ page.
