Change Log
==========

Version 0.11.0
--------------

- Rework the *BagOfWords* algorithm to match the description of the algorithm
  in the original paper.

- Update the *SAXVSM* classifier with the new version of *BagOfWords*.

- Add the *BagOfPatterns* algorithm in the :mod:`pyts.transformation` module.

- Add the *ROCKET* algorithm in the :mod:`pyts.transformation` module.

- Add the *LearningShapelets* algorithm in the :mod:`pyts.classification`
  module.


Version 0.10.0
--------------

- Adapt DTW functions to compare time series with different lengths
  (by Hicham Janati)

- Add a ``precomputed_cost`` parameter in DTW variants that are compatible
  with a precomputed cost matrix, that is classical DTW and DTW with global
  constraint regions like Sakoe-Chiba band and Itakura parallelogram
  (by Hicham Janati)

- Add a new algorithm called *ShapeletTransform* in the :mod:`pyts.transformation`
  module.

- Add a new dependency, the *joblib* Python package, since it has been vendored
  from scikit-learn and it is used in ShapeletTransform.

- [DOC] Revamp documentation in most sections:

  * User guide is much more detailed
  * A *Scikit-learn compatibility* page has been added to highlight the compatibility
    of pyts estimators with scikit-learn tools like model selection and pipelines.
  * A *Reproducibility* page has been added to highlight the work done in the
    `pyts-repro <https://github.com/johannfaouzi/pyts-repro>`_ repository,
    where we compare the performance of our implementations to the literature.
  * A *Contributing guide* has been added.


Version 0.9.0
-------------

- Add `datasets` module with dataset loading utilities

- Add `multivariate` module with utilities for multivariate time series

- Revamp the tests using `pytest.mark.parametrize`

- Add an `Examples` section in most of the public functions and classes

- Require version 1.3.0 of scipy: this is required to load ARFF files
  with relational attributes using `scipy.io.arff.loadarff`


Version 0.8.0
-------------

- No more Python 2 support

- New package required: numba

- Updated required versions of packages

- Modification of the API:

  - `quantization` module merged in `approximation` and removed

  - `bow` module renamed `bag_of_words`

  - Fewer acronyms used for the names of the classes: if an algorithm has a name
    with three words or fewer, the whole name is used.

  - More preprocessing tools in `preprocessing` module

  - New module `metrics` with metrics specific to time series

- Improved tests using pytest tools

- Reworked documentation

- Updated continuous integration scripts

- More optimized code using numba
