Multivariate time series
========================

Most of the literature for time series classification is focused on univariate
time series. Nonetheless, several algorithms for multivariate time series
classification have been published. We also provide simple utilities to extend
algorithms for univariate time series to multivariate time series.
They can be found in the :mod:`pyts.multivariate` module.


Classification
--------------

.. currentmodule:: pyts.multivariate.classification

:class:`MultivariateClassifier` extends any classifier for univariate time series
to multivariate time series using majority voting: a classifier is fitted
for each feature of the multivariate time series, then a majority vote is
performed at prediction time.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from pyts.classification import BOSSVS
    >>> from pyts.datasets import load_basic_motions
    >>> from pyts.multivariate.classification import MultivariateClassifier
    >>> X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = load_basic_motions(return_X_y=True)
    >>> clf = MultivariateClassifier(BOSSVS())
    >>> clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    MultivariateClassifier(...)
    >>> clf.score(X_test, y_test)
    1.0

Transformation
--------------

.. currentmodule:: pyts.multivariate.transformation

:class:`MultivariateTransformer` extends any transformer for univariate time series
to multivariate time series: a transformer is fitted for each feature of the
multivariate time series, then the transformation for each feature is
performed. The ``flatten`` parameter controls the shape of the output. If
each transformation has the same shape, ``flatten=False`` does not flatten
the output, while ``flatten=True`` flattens the output. If some transformations
do not have the same shapes, the output is always flattened.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from pyts.datasets import load_basic_motions
    >>> from pyts.multivariate.transformation import MultivariateTransformer
    >>> from pyts.image import GramianAngularField
    >>> X, _, _, _ = load_basic_motions(return_X_y=True)
    >>> transformer = MultivariateTransformer(GramianAngularField(),
    ...                                       flatten=False)
    >>> X_new = transformer.fit_transform(X)
    >>> X_new.shape
    (40, 6, 100, 100)
    >>> transformer.set_params(flatten=True)
    >>> X_new = transformer.fit_transform(X)
    >>> X_new.shape
    (40, 60000)

:class:`WEASELMUSE` is an extension of :ref:`transformation_weasel` to
multivariate time series. It stands for **WEASEL** plus
**M**\ ultivariate **U**\ nsupervised **S**\ ymbols and d\ **E**\ rivatives.
It performs an extraction of words for each feature on the original time
series and their derivatives and derives their frequencies.

   :scale: 80%

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from pyts.datasets import load_basic_motions
    >>> from pyts.multivariate.transformation import WEASELMUSE
    >>> X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = load_basic_motions(return_X_y=True)
    >>> transformer = WEASELMUSE()
    >>> X_new = transformer.fit_transform(X_train, y_train)
    >>> X_new.shape
    (40, 9086)

Classification can be performed with any standard classifier. In the example
below, we use a logistic regression::

    >>> from pyts.datasets import load_basic_motions
    >>> from pyts.multivariate.transformation import WEASELMUSE
    >>> from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
    >>> from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    >>> X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = load_basic_motions(return_X_y=True)
    >>> transformer = WEASELMUSE()
    >>> logistic = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear', multi_class='ovr')
    >>> clf = make_pipeline(transformer, logistic)
    >>> clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    Pipeline(...)
    >>> clf.score(X_test, y_test)
    0.975

Image
-----

.. currentmodule:: pyts.multivariate.image

:class:`JointRecurrencePlot` is an extension of a :ref:`image_rp` for multivariate
time series. For each feature of a multivariate time series, a recurrence plot
is constructed. The set of recurrence plots is merged into a single joint
recurrence plot using the Hadamard product between all the matrices.

    >>> transformer = JointRecurrencePlot()
    >>> X_new = transformer.transform(X)
    >>> X_new.shape
