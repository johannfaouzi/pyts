Bag of words for time series

.. currentmodule:: pyts.bag_of_words

Several algorithms for time series classification are based on bag-of-words
approaches: a sequence of symbols is transformed into a bag of words.
Utilities to derive bag of words are provided in the :mod:`pyts.bag_of_words`
module.

Bag of words
------------

:class:`BagOfWords` extracts subseries using a sliding window, then transforms
each subseries into a word using the :ref:`approximation_paa` and
:ref:`approximation_sax` algorithms. Therefore :class:`BagOfWords` trasnforms
each time series into a bag of words. The sliding window can be controlled
with the ``window_size`` and ``window_step`` parameters. The length of
each word can be set with the ``word_size`` parameter, while the ``n_bins``
parameter controls the size of the alphabet to discretize time series.
The ``numerosity_reduction`` parameter controls the removal of all but one
occurrence of identical consecutive words.

    >>> bow.transform(X)

    >>> bow.set_params(numerosity_reduction=False)
    BagOfWords(...)
    >>> bow.transform(X)
    array(['abcd abcd abcd', 'abcd abcd abcd'], dtype='<U14')


Word Extractor
--------------

:class:`WordExtractor` extracts words from a sequence of symbols. This sequence
of symbols is usually a discretized time series or discretized Fourier
coefficients of a time series. Words are extracted using a sliding window
that can be controlled with the ``window_size`` and ``window_step`` parameters.
The ``numerosity_reduction`` parameter controls the removal of all but one
occurrence of identical consecutive words. The impact of this parameter is illustrated
in the following example: when a time series has low variation over several
time points, the discretized time series is constant, which leads to several
identical consecutive words. Removed words are almost transparent.

    >>> word = WordExtractor(window_size=2)
    >>> print(word.transform(X))
    ['aa ab ba ab bb ba' 'ab bc cc ca aa ac']
    >>> word = WordExtractor(window_size=2, numerosity_reduction=False)
    >>> print(word.transform(X))
    ['aa ab ba ab bb bb bb ba' 'ab bc cc cc cc ca aa ac']
