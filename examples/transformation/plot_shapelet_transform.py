==================
Shapelet Transform
==================

The Shapelet Transform algorithm extracts shapelets from a data set of
time series and returns the distances between the shapelets and the time
series. A shapelet is defined as a subset of a time series, that is a
set of values from consecutive time points. The distance between a shapelet
and a time series is defined as the minimum of the distances between this
shapelet and all the shapelets of same length extracted from this time series.
The most discriminative shapelets are selected.
This example illustrates the transformation of this algorithm and highlights
the most discriminative shapelets that have been selected. It is implemented
as :class:`pyts.transformation.ShapeletTransform`.
