"""Time series transformation and classification module for Python.

pyts is a Python package for time series classification.
It aims to make time series classification easily accessible by providing
preprocessing and utility tools, and implementations of state-of-the-art
algorithms. Most of these algorithms transform time series, thus pyts provides
several tools to perform these transformations.
