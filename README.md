## pyts: a Python package for time series classification

pyts is a Python package for time series classification. It
aims to make time series classification easily accessible by providing
preprocessing and utility tools, and implementations of
state-of-the-art algorithms. Most of these algorithms transform time series,
thus pyts provides several tools to perform these transformations.


### Installation

#### Dependencies

pyts requires:

- Python (>= 3.7)
- NumPy (>= 1.17.5)
- SciPy (>= 1.3.0)
- Scikit-Learn (>=0.22.1)
- Joblib (>=0.12)
- Numba (>=0.48.0)

To run the examples Matplotlib (>=2.0.0) is required.


#### User installation

If you already have a working installation of numpy, scipy, scikit-learn,
joblib and numba, you can easily install pyts using ``pip``

    pip install pyts

or ``conda`` via the ``conda-forge`` channel

    conda install -c conda-forge pyts

You can also get the latest version of pyts by cloning the repository

    git clone https://github.com/johannfaouzi/pyts.git
    cd pyts
    pip install .


#### Testing

After installation, you can launch the test suite from outside the source
directory using pytest:

    pytest pyts


### Changelog

See the [changelog](https://pyts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html)
for a history of notable changes to pyts.

### Development

The development of this package is in line with the one of the scikit-learn
community. Therefore, you can refer to their
[Development Guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/). A slight
difference is the use of Numba instead of Cython for optimization.
