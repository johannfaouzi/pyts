pyts is a Python package for time series transformation and classification. It
aims to provide state-of-the-art as well as recently published algorithms
for time series classification. Most of these algorithms transform time series,
thus pyts provides several tools to perform these transformations.

# Installation

## Dependencies

pyts has been tested on Python 2.7 and 3.5 with the following dependencies:

- numpy (>= 1.8.2)
- scipy (>= 0.13.3)
- scikit-learn (>=0.17.0)
- future (>=0.13.0) (for Python 2 compatibility)

To run the examples matplotlib is required (matplotlib >= 2.0.0 has
been tested).

## User installation

If you already have a working installation of numpy, scipy and
scikit-learn, you can easily install pyts using ``pip``

    pip install pyts

You can also get the latest version of pyts by cloning the repository

    git clone https://github.com/johannfaouzi/pyts.git
    cd pyts
    pip install .
